Centered Signal Constellation
    signal_point = cos(2*pi()*1000*t(1,n))*amplitude;
    signal_point = sin(2*pi()*1000*t(1,n))*amplitude;

Empirical tuning of carrier amplitude and bit interval
1. This pair of values worked well (overall score Chris Rose score: ~800)
bit_interval = 2;         % Carrier period
amplitude = 7.04;         % Scaler on how much energy to use
carriers: sin and cos at frequency 1000.

Adaptive amplitude from energy budget
1. Calculate the energy based on modulation scheme, based on bit interval, carrier function.
2. Based on projected total energy use, calculate the amplitude scalar.
Note: This makes sure that we use all of our energy, no more and no less.
Observation: As long as we change amplitude/energy with respect to bit_interval, neither bit_interval nor ampltude affects the final score. In other words, we can transmit as fast as possible (by having small bit_interval but high power use--fast and hard) or we can transmit as slow as possible (long bit interval and low power--slow and steady).

Choosing/optimizing how many bits to send in total
1. Given a specific energy budget, find the balance between bits to send (N in the final score) and accuracy (cross entropy)

Adaptive frequency hopping
Comment: Can be used as a 
1. Observation: r_trans and r_reci does know what's going on with the noise. We can stop sending and analyze the noise.
2. Since we have shown that
