Created a separate function to only handle modulation
1. See function carriers=modulation_scheme(...)

Centered Signal Constellation
    signal_point = cos(2*pi()*1000*t(1,n))*amplitude;
    signal_point = sin(2*pi()*1000*t(1,n))*amplitude;

Empirical tuning of carrier amplitude and bit interval
1. This pair of values worked well (overall score Chris Rose score: ~500)
bit_interval = 130;         % Carrier period
amplitude = 1.2;              % Scaler on how much energy to use

Adaptive amplitude from energy budget (ongoing)
1. Calculate the energy based on modulation scheme, based on bit interval, carrier function.
2. Based on projected total energy use, calculate the amplitude scalar.
